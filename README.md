## Speech Markdown Test Files

The open source version of the Speech Markdown Test Files

The files contained in this project are to assist those writing parsers, formatters, libraries, and other software to have a consistent set of test data files.

These files are not for a specific testing framework, rather they contain Speech Markdown formatted text and what the corresponding text would be after a formatter has converted it. Samples are shown for Plain Text as well as platform-specifice Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML).

Each group of test files are in their own folder and file naming follows this convention:

| extension | description
| --- | --- |
| `.smd` | Speech Markdown |
| `.txt` | Converted to Plain Text |
| `.alexa.ssml` | SSML - Amazon Alexa |
| `.google.ssml` | SSML - Google Assistant |

All data files are under the `test-data` folder.


We welcome your contributions to improving this project. All submissions will be reviewed for technical accuracy and possibly reworded to comply with style guidelines required by our editorial team.

The goal of this project is to support voice designers, developers, and tool creators in adoption and enhancement of Speech Markdown. We want you to be successful. If this project is not helping you achieve your goals, then please let us know where we can do a better job. Thank you for your contributions!
